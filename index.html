						<p style="font-size: 18px;">As the principle owner at CN I oversee the day to day operations and long term goals of the network, including Colin's development and technical work. 
							Colin has taken an extremely active role in our development team, essentially taking over any and all Python duties, as well as contributing elsewhere whenever it is asked of him. 
							Due to his determination towards improving the network and his development skills we have been able to replace several old and outdated systems with either new revisions of the original code, or with brand new code. 
							Colin has become the multitool of our development team, meaning that whenever we run into an issue or have a new project we want them to undertake, we turn to Colin to lead the charge. 
							I simply cannot emphasize how much having Colin as a part of our team has enhanced our business as a whole and specifically our development team.</p>
